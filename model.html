        <p>I often scribble half-baked ideas, reactions to things I’ve read, or something useful I’ve heard. Sometimes they turn into longer blog posts or projects, but most of them sit in my notes app, unused.</p>

<p>For several years, I decided to publish these as a faster way to get ideas out there. Topics loosely cover governance, research culture, ethics, social dynamics online, and all other sorts of randomness.</p>

<p>I stopped updating these in 2021, but you’re welcome to browse previous years below. I might start doing it again someday, but I’m enjoying having a bit of private brain space for now.</p>

<p>When quoting a private conversation, I’ve defaulted to anonymity for obvious reasons, but if you see something you said that you’d like attributed to you, just let me know and I’ll add your name.</p>

<p>(Please note: you are crawling my brain. These are rough notes, which means ideas are experimental and conviction level is highly variable!)</p>

<p>Screenshotting as one of the essential underrated tools of the digital age - the equivalent of inventing cameras for the physical world, so we can take “pictures” of everything happening around us in the digital realm, and share + discuss it</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-29">2020-12-29</h2>
<p>I wonder how the timing of a startup’s “breakout year” can affect its outcomes (if it happens in year 1 vs. 3 vs. 7, say), if at all</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-28">2020-12-28</h2>
<p>Thinking about the idea of communities being “irrelevant”…I think I picture them instead more like blowing soap bubbles. They start forming on your wand, grow bigger, then eventually are sealed off and pushed out into the world…and perhaps eventually pop and everyone within goes their own merry way</p>

<p>Point being that it’s not that they become irrelevant, some of them just seal off and become these fully-enclosed cultural ecosystems that work just fine for the ppl involved, perhaps indefinitely (the “club”-style commmunities from Working in Public?). Like, hippies or hackers are still a thing, even if they’re not the zeitgeist anymore, they just float about in our periphery as self-contained, but seemingly healthy, communities. Or Twitter circles that bubble up and float and away, only to be replaced by new ones. (Another image that comes to mind: those sealed glass toy balls you can buy that have an entire ecosystem growing in them)</p>

<p>There’s just something about that relationship between communities, vs. the “zeitgeist” substrate in which they are birthed, that I find interesting…like when we’re witnessing a “relevant” community, what we’re really witnessing is the forming of a soap bubble / the birthing + adolescence of that community, and eventually they mature and float off elsewhere into the world. Like, a community’s life extends far beyond its life “on stage,” and the way we talk about communities being relevant/not is not unlike how we talk about youth culture in general, or aging and ppl’s perceived relevance…does that make any sense?</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-27">2020-12-27</h2>
<p>Have a strange desire to meet the developers behind the forums I used to frequent as a teenager: to know what they were thinking at the time, how they saw us and our petty dramas. Like wanting to meet your maker/creator (could be a fun short story)</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-15">2020-12-15</h2>
<p>Need a name for this effect that’s like…tech ppl (or any other hyper-specific group) don’t want to be reminded that they’re all tech ppl interacting w/ primarily only other tech ppl. So if you’re designing something for them, you have to impart this feeling of “authenticity”, even if it’s not always true</p>

<p>It’s like when tourists don’t want to be reminded they’re tourists, they want to go to the secret local watering holes, and so even though sometimes it’s actually a tourist watering hole, they have to try to create a “locals” feel</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-15-1">2020-12-15</h2>
<p>There should be like an anti-distribution counterculture movement on social platforms: ppl writing tweets, posts, etc that they know <em>won’t</em> go viral, and they prefer it that way. Like I don’t know why we’ve all assumed that everyone is trying to go viral or get more eyeballs? (I guess in some ways, this is already happening? But it’s more like, ppl moving to quieter platforms, vs. shifting their behavior on existing platforms)</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-15-2">2020-12-15</h2>
<p>This constant tension between “what is valued within an institution is different from what’s valued by the broader market” (and usually your external value depreciates within an institution). Ex. an independent researcher can easily publish ideas with merit on their own, but within academia, they’d be considered “uncredentialed.” Or status games are v different in a traditional work environment vs. on Twitter</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-09">2020-12-09</h2>
<p>Still thinking about how I use Twitter DM, FB Msgr, iMessage, Whatsapp, and Signal differently. I think there’s a crossover there between how I feel about WSIWYG post editors vs. a text editor: the interface shapes how I think and interact w/ others</p>

<p>Which is like, an obvious statement in some sense. It’s almost too broad of a statement to even be interesting, at the highest level. But when I consider it in the case-by-case sense (ex. realizing that I even talk to the same <em>person</em> differently on text vs. Twitter DM), it feels worth examining</p>

<p>Ex. usually for me, crossing over to iMessage feels like inviting you into my house. I only use iMessage with a fairly small group of friends, and I try not to use it with someone I don’t know that well, even though there’s nothing actually more or less intimate about using iMessage vs., say, FB Msgr to talk to the same person</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a reverse association, like looking at a dozen long-stemmed roses, which aren’t inherently romantic, but the association is hard to ignore if you were to receive them from a friend</p>

<p>Or maybe it’s about drawing (semi-arbitrary) physical boundaries in digital spaces: I need ways to differentiate between the digital equivalent of talking to someone in the street vs. at a restaurant vs. in my house, and drawing the line between diff apps lends a bit of physicality to those relationships</p>

<p>This also gets even more complicated bc everyone’s taxonomy is different - ex. other ppl use iMessage liberally with new acquaintances, for work, etc, whereas to me it’s more of a private space. Or some ppl will quickly follow a new acquaintance on Instagram/Twitter, whereas other ppl have a higher bar for who they choose to let in. So is it actually something inherent to the interface, or just my own associations with it, that make me feel differently about diff messaging apps? And isn’t it kind of a clusterfuck that we all have different associations with different apps, in terms of how we get to know each other?</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-07">2020-12-07</h2>
<p>There’s a popular argument that, some years from now, we’ll look back and see meat-eating as barbaric and exploitative. Can we make a similar argument that at some point, we’ll look back and see having sex as barbaric and exploitative, too? If the main biological purpose of sex is to reproduce, and we’re not so far from being able to do that entirely without sex, then maybe any remaining sexual desire will be channeled through intimacy rather than straight-up sexual intercourse (see the evolution from, e.g., prostitution -&gt; porn -&gt; camming -&gt; OF / IG thirst traps / TikTok bf POVs / etc, it’s gotten progressively less sexual and more intimate). Like intimacy was the thing we’re really after, and sex was always just a byproduct of that. Similarly to the argument that we can make meat in a lab now, so why kill animals? (To be totally clear, I think both arguments are a bit insane, but wondering if the meat-eating logic is extendable to other “natural” things)</p>

<h2 id="2020-12-05">2020-12-05</h2>
<p>Thinking about the fungibility of friendships: I have some friends I’ll text/share the same things to, not like “hi how are you” but like very specific types of content that <em>feel</em> individualized but are actually semi-fungible (and I’m also on the receiving end of this, of course) - does that mean those friendships are redundant, or just resilient? (i.e. perhaps it’s good to have redundancy in valuable friendships)</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-28">2020-11-28</h2>
<p>Is there a word for the opposite of a simulacrum, where the imitation becomes more “real” than the original?</p>

<p>Ex. Heinz ketchup is more ketchup-like than whatever came before it. Or when a celebrity’s brand becomes more “them” than the original person it derives from</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-26">2020-11-26</h2>
<p>“Men seek status for sex, women seek status for pretty dresses” - the surface level interpretation here is that women are materialistic or superficial, but I think it goes one level deeper: it suggests that, unlike men, women don’t directly <em>need</em> anything from the opposite sex, which gets to this idea of “femininity as nihilism” that I keep coming back to, but can’t quite get my hands around (but goes something like: left to their own devices, women just DGAF about anything, whereas left to their own devices, men will tear each other apart. Not saying one is better than the other, just that to me, “nihilistic femininity” is such a different picture from our typical image of femininity, usually described as more catty and competitive, and I feel like it’s still underexplored in pop culture)</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-25">2020-11-25</h2>
<p>Thinking about working on “task forces” instead of companies…not every company could be a task force ofc, but I like the idea of reframing how we think about careers, more about serving terms / “tours of duty” on diff problems</p>

<p>I mean this in good faith: I would like to see someone create a (high quality) crash course in venture capital + advertising for journalists. Feels like it would combat so much of the mistrust and apprehension around these industries. Also, I’m tired of seeing bad takes that are bad bc they are uninformed (bad takes are fine, but at least get the facts right…)</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-14">2020-11-14</h2>
<p>Does anyone specialize in “artisanal reproductions” of old websites? Like the way ppl are into antique reproductions, but instead of the exact lead paint or gold leaf or whatever that was used in that historical era, instead you spend time faithfully replicating the exact look + tech stack, framework, stylesheets, etc required to achieve a certain button or scroll style. It’d be a part-history, part-technology sort of hobby</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-11">2020-11-11</h2>
<p>(continuation from previous thoughts) Why aren’t conservatives attracted to working in media? (a reverse look at the “why is media so liberal?” q) The lazy answer is that it’s liberal-dominated already and they don’t feel comfortable working there. A semi-interesting answer (prev explored) is it doesn’t pay well, which doesn’t align with conservative values / raison d’etre. An even more interesting answer is that conservatives are simply less likely to thrive / succeed working in media bc the job of media is to dilute hard truths and speak to the masses</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-05">2020-11-05</h2>
<p>I want to read an analysis of how tech platforms’ relationship to censorship has changed over time. There was the hyper-libertarian Reddit / Blogspot / etc era, now there’s this explicit censorship era that leans into an editorializing / curator role, what are the implications of that + what’s next in terms of “censorship trends”? Would like to see an analysis from a poli sci perspective, like how diff forms of government evolve over the years</p>

<h2 id="2020-11-03">2020-11-03</h2>
<p>I’ve been trying to put my thoughts together for years around why I don’t like leaderboards (or, rather: they’re good for some things, but not others, and when are they not good and why?)…one thing I don’t like about them is that you’re kinda leaving it to “the algorithm” to tell our story around what success looks like, it’s a passive approach to brand building and storytelling. Like if Patreon had leaderboards, their top creators would be NSFW artists or whatever, but Patreon doesn’t want to be (solely) known as the NSFW art website, they want to play an active role in shaping their brand.</p>

<p>The other big thing I don’t love about leaderboards, but struggle to put into words, is how they unlock competitive game mechanics for the ppl involved, vs. encouraging them to be competition with themselves. And I think many (most?) creators are in competition with themselves more than others, maybe also true of some athletes, like yes you’re trying to be the best that’s out there, but it’s by distilling yourself into the purest version of you, vs. like, looking at what other ppl are doing</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-30">2020-10-30</h2>
<p>(from a friend) We mistakenly believe there are two sides to an issue and we just need to show “the other side”, when in reality it’s more like five hundred sides. So this idea of both sides-ism, or being able to simply show “another side”, is not an achievable thing</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-29">2020-10-29</h2>
<p>(continuation of a previous q) Examples of “bloodless cultural revolutions”…growing widespread acceptance of sex work might be one? Hard for me to think about one specific “battle” that was won that led to more widespread acceptance (unless we include birth control, barrier contraception, etc as the underlying technologies required to get us there, but I’m thinking in more recent years, like even the last 20ish years)</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-29-1">2020-10-29</h2>
<p>(from a friend) Adversarial training as an approach to writing: we’ve been trained so that we’re always anticipating the worst from public response, but that fear actually creates a lot of clarity in our thinking bc we’re forced to always argue the other side, be more subtle/deliberate in how we write, create nuance by going super meta instead of super literal. I like this concept</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-29-2">2020-10-29</h2>
<p>It’s weird that historically (I think? Esp for fiction?), ppl don’t publish books until later in life, after they’ve had a bunch of life experiences. But today, it seems like ppl who make it big as content creators are often younger/earlier in life</p>

<p>Is it bc it’s a fundamentally different type of content creation? Ex. “learning in public”-style creation is more accessible to young ppl, whereas writing fiction is better when you’re older. Or is the fact that ppl didn’t become writers til they were older a historical anomaly that has now been “fixed”? (ex. they couldn’t afford it, financially or reputationally, until they were older, but now it’s easier to do so)</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-24">2020-10-24</h2>
<p>Is there a reason why (I think) true crime, erotica tend to be more women-dominated, vs horror movies and hard porn being more men-dominated? (Ok not sure about horror, but I’m guessing true crime overindexes on women, even if horror isn’t male-dominant) Like it’s a similar type of information in either case, but via different delivery methods (e.g. text instead of imagery)</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-05">2020-10-05</h2>
<p>Are there the same long tail/few winner dynamics on Etsy as there are on Patreon? Does the average Etsy seller make more than the average Patreon creator? Why/why not?</p>

<p>Maybe said another way: it feels like there are much higher expectations of “anybody can do this” with creator platforms like Patreon, and ppl getting upset when they don’t make it big, but for like, professional basketball, not everyone expects to make it into the NBA. What’s interesting though is it doesn’t deter thousands of ppl from aspiring to the big leagues. On balance, the fact that very few ppl make it into the NBA doesn’t seem to suppress the desire to try. I’m guessing bc the NBA (or whomever) does a good job making it seem glamorous and aspiration-worthy. Like why are there no media articles about “I tried to get into the NBA and I failed”? Is it bc the concept of these creator platforms are newer, and we haven’t yet set our expectations appropriately? Is it about the culture that surrounds certain types of creator platforms (think Patreon vs. YouTube)? Is it that a platform feels inherently more open and democratic than making it as a professional athlete?</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-04">2020-10-04</h2>
<p>Thinking about ppl who work in “retail” knowledge production / content creation, vs. original production (“wholesale?”)</p>

<p>Like some ppl are coming up with the initial ideas, vs. other ppl work in “retail” to bring their ideas to market</p>

<p>I also think one person can manufacture wholesale knowledge for some concepts, while working retail on others - these aren’t archetypes of <em>people</em>, but of their relationship to the knowledge/content they create. Depending on the topic, I’m sometimes happier working retail bc it means you’re less of a target / center of attention, while still helping the cause</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-30">2020-09-30</h2>
<p>Always surprised we don’t talk more about the decline of the hashtag. I mean I’m sure they’re still widely used in absolute terms, but they were initially an era-defining feature for early social media (both Twitter and Instagram!) that have now fallen into relative disuse</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but the hashtag’s fate seems stranger to me vs. other online social trends that fade away. It’s not like the actual product feature went away, which would then allow us to be nostalgic about it. Twitter never got rid of hashtags, people just like…decided they didn’t want/need to use them as much anymore</p>

<p>Trying to think of the right analogy…it’s like a neighborhood or a restaurant that used to be really trendy but isn’t anymore, but that’s still around? Hmm I don’t think that’s actually quite right, bc those sorts of things fall prey to kitsch, and I wouldn’t really call hashtags kitschy. I feel more like they’re some extraneous appendange that’s still attached to Twitter, like a washed-up has-been who still goes to all the cool kid parties instead of moving on. Ok maybe that’s not right either. Not sure if this is making any sense</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-24">2020-09-24</h2>
<p>There is a moral argument to be made that simply donating large amounts of money is itself sterile and removed from the ecosystem it’s trying to affect. Maybe, e.g. Mark’s attempt at Newark public school reform failed bc he was treating his greatest value as being a paycheck to someone else’s strategy, instead of leveraging his resources and network to come up with his own solution</p>

<p>I know that’s an overly simplistic and somewhat unfair analysis of the problem (donating $100M always comes with strings attached), but you look at ex. Bezos creating his own preschools via Bezos Academy, and it’s just like a radically different approach. (And maybe one doesn’t supplant the other - Bezos is also donating to other educational orgs - but you can imagine “going your own way” as one strategy in a more blended portfolio approach, vs. just figuring out who to give to. Many philanthropic grantmaking strategies seem to start at the q of “what’s the problem, now who should we give to” rather than “what’s the problem, now what are all the diff things we can do to impact it” - which is something I always found appealing about Chan-Zuckerberg being structured as an LLC)</p>

<p>Sort of like the argument about aristocracy being in some ways more ethical than today, bc big wealthy families were taking care of their staff, vs. in a democracy, where ppl w/o means don’t having any social safety net whatsoever (Or rather: in a democracy that social safety net is <em>supposed</em> to be gov’t, but that doesn’t always pan out so well…)</p>

<p>There’s probably also a software analogy to be made here: building a system using other ppl’s components, vs. attempting to build your own clean system from scratch. At its worst, the latter is a futile exercise in hubris, but at its best, it’s deeply inspiring</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-23">2020-09-23</h2>
<p>Looking for a pro-death / anti-natalism reading list. Not bc it’s really my thing, I just think it’d be a nice palate cleanser from longevity as the default-optimism take</p>

<p>(from a Twitter convo) “Save as draft” as default mode, instead of “publish” as default. Notetaking apps as living on a continuum with social software, could theoretically merge together</p>

<p>It’s crazy how many calls I’ve had with ppl who say “I’ve always identified as a writer, but I didn’t think I could make money doing it, so I did XYZ  career path instead”</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-20">2020-09-20</h2>
<p>Would like to read more about the internet’s unbundling effect on political parties. As in: Democrats, Republicans, etc are the “institutions,” but now you can have all these weird and interesting tiny political parties and mini-movements that spin up and die all the time. A lot has obviously been written about the internet’s weakening effects on political institutions, but I’m specifically interested in how it’s also enabled a proliferation of lightweight, digitally-native political parties that are almost interacting w/ each other on a different plane of existence vs. “real” political parties</p>

<p>The strange part is that these two realities seem pretty divorced from each other (ex. boogaloo boys are not exactly trying to get a seat in Congress AFAIK, or you could point to BLM not getting representation in Democratic politics, despite its popularity) but I keep waiting/wondering when digitally-native and geographically-native politics will eventually collide. And what it will take to get there. Or will one just subsume another?</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-20-1">2020-09-20</h2>
<p>Thinking about the diff b/w “stability” and “commitment.” Working a comfortable job that you hate is “stable,” but I actually think it’s a sign of weak commitment - a lack of commitment to your own passions, dreams, and goals (assuming you aren’t staying bc of commitment to other things, ofc, like a family or other forms of caretaking)</p>

<p>It’s strange to think about how I’d be literally incapable of writing the same book if I’d started it in 2020, bc I’m not in the same mental space anymore. It’s just weird that ppl can produce these bodies of work or writing or thinking, but then be unable to do that same thing X number of years later. We say this person is the “author” of that work or like an “expert” on the topic, but it was really only in their head for a fleeting amount of time, so is it really about them at all? Or were they just a transient translator of an idea?</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-17">2020-09-17</h2>
<p>I keep having this thing where I know I’m working remotely, but I forget that other ppl I talk to are doing the same - ex. if I call customer service or my bank or whatever, I still picture them in a big call center or a fancy office. Was startled to remember they’re probably wearing sweatpants and sitting on the floor of their bedroom like me</p>

<p>There’s something there about how our reference points for phone convos don’t necessarily come from immediate sensory inputs (e.g. the person themselves or what is actually taking place), vs. relying on past memories / expectations to fill in the visuals. I find something sort of unsettling about it - like I’m alive but interacting with elements that are not alive, or more static than they seem. Like zipping through an amusement park ride filled with cardboard characters</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-17-1">2020-09-17</h2>
<p>Wonder how much the disgust reaction to ex. a homogeneous team page on a website or whatever is similar to the way that ppl recoil at the sight of a row of homogeneous-looking buildings in a city (as in, the distaste is primarily aesthetic, then backwards-justified as sociopolitical)</p>

<p>“Designing” groups of ppl like we design cities…? (I don’t even mean this in a crass way, I actually think it could get more ppl to similar outcomes / provide a diff lens for understanding the value of doing that work)</p>

<h2 id="2020-09-16">2020-09-16</h2>
<p>Companies as Schelling points for impact (again, “great prophet” rather than “great founder” theory)</p>

<p>Instead of “it’s a great founder who drove this forward,” it’s more like “this is happening in the world whether we like it or not and you guys happen to be at the center of it.” I don’t think that describes every company, but it probably describes a lot of co’s that became the default choice for their sector but failed to become truly “great”</p>

<p>Ways of creating serendipity online - are stadium-style communities particularly well-suited for this? (Specifically in terms of addressing the serendipity q, i.e. meeting ppl outside of your known social circles) I feel like they’re well-primed bc you’re in a high-context situation and also you’re both “watching the stage,” so you have this built-in activity you’re already doing together (vs. in a more loosely-coupled community structure). You can already answer the question of “we are gathered here to do X”</p>

<p>Like meeting someone in the chat box while watching our mutual friend do an acrostic on YouTube feels like a very natural way to meet someone new, moreso than in a giant online Zoom or whatever, bc your interactions are less flattened out (Robin Sloan’s “orthographic” social media concept)</p>

<p>Small group chats are block-y, but stadiums can be porous and help naturally facilitate some of that serendipity. You’re shooting up a beacon or a signal flare and seeing who responds</p>

<p>Wonder if ppl have become more humble / cautious about what they don’t know bc it’s so much easier to verify and fact-check knowledge</p>

<p>In some ways I find the whole misinformation concept difficult to parse, bc isn’t it way easier to fact-check than ever before? Maybe the rise of “misinformation” is really just our collective “emperor has no clothes” reaction to suddenly being confronted with all the world’s truths that we hadn’t had such easy access to before, and realizing how much we didn’t know or had wrong?</p>

<p>Taking the “atomization of X” to its logical next progression, I wonder if there will be a decaying or “brain drain” of the firm, if the very best ppl realizes they can just go off and do things on their own instead of joining a company</p>

<p>Not sure that will happen though, bc working at a company / working with other ppl will always have the potential for a diff kind of impact that working solo does not. Like maybe some institutions (like newspapers) will be slimmed down, but not every kind of company is atomizable. (Or rather, maybe that is the Coasean condition: <em>if</em>/when a firm offers higher opportunity for impact, i.e. lower coordination costs, then ppl won’t defect)</p>

<p>So then I guess my q is whether that is ever going to also be true for creators? At what point does atomization max out on relative impact?</p>

<p>(from a convo) Online communities that are tied to a physical identity (ex. Nextdoor, alumni communities) function differently bc it’s harder to defect and leave. But they’re also not necessarily “high-context” communities in the sense of, say, a small town or meetup group. They’re sort in this in-between limbo space, where drama can even be much worse bc you intuitively <em>assume</em> shared values based on physical identity, but actually at a certain scale there isn’t that level of context at all</p>

<p>Kind of like the “jury duty” effect? You would expect that 12 randomly-selected San Francisco residents would be somewhat familiar to you in terms of identity/values, but actually they’re shockingly different from what one might’ve guessed.

<p>I think there’s a diff between “content moderation” and setting expectations for civil interactions. Like a platform finding ways to encourage ppl to be civil to each other isn’t censorship, to me (done well, they should barely notice you’re even doing it). And I think that DOES, or at least can, fall in the purview of what a platform should be tasked with doing, bc it’s basically what any gov’t does as well (creates and enforces laws that foster a safe, civil society). That seems v different to me from removing ideas that a platform thinks are harmful - but if we focus on doing more of the expectation-setting stuff well, I wonder if that would help reduce the majority of what is <em>actually</em> concerning to ppl about “harmful” ideas (inciting violence, harassment, etc)</p>

<p>Maybe that’s a little naive? But it’s similar for open source communities, too, where being an effective leader doesn’t always mean letting ppl say whatever they want, even if you’re very pro-free speech. I think the best leaders learn there is an art to creating the right environment for that to actually happen (“no assholes” rule, etc), where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves, and it doesn’t come about by staying out of it entirely</p>

<p>I guess I’m just still intrigued by this counterintuitive idea of platforms leaning <em>into</em> their editorial positions, and how that could be a good thing, depending how it’s executed. Bc we know on the other hand that being totally absent is a recipe for disaster, even if it’s with good intentions (to not moderate anything), you end up with total anarchy. So a platform has to have <em>some</em> involvement, but the gray area is “what does it mean to lean into your editorial position.” Feels like encouraging civil interactions, regardless of the content involved, might be a good place to start</p>

<p>Regarding the q of “why don’t friend communes work?” – there’s something to the idea of like…you appreciate your friends most when you’re able to flit about in a broader social environment and know you come back to each other of your own free will. Your friends are your copilots helping you make sense of the rest of the world</p>

<p>Whereas in a friend commune, you’re basically locked into the same proverbial room with the same ppl, no ability to explore elsewhere, and it makes you kinda crazy in the end. You need that porousness of a “natural” social environment to appreciate them, vs. cutting them out at the roots and planting them somewhere unnatural (this kinda goes with the “weak ties” thing, see note 2020-05-22)</p>

<p>Thinking about the ways in which gov’t vs. philanthropy vs. corporations participate differently as institutional actors, and how I’ve been forced to think about that wrt open source (which has been fun to consider!). Ex. it makes sense for a philanthropic org to start a grant program for funding research or “field-building” activities; they might also fund projects, but will eventually run into the q of “how does this project reach self-sustainability and/or where do we find later-stage funders for their work” (the latter being not dissimilar to VC). Corporations have a more direct relationship to OSS projects and are more likely to engage in ongoing financial transactions. And gov’t <em>could</em> go the philanthropic route (e.g. grant programs), but really the role of gov’t is to help incentivize new behaviors at a systemic level that no other institutional actor could do otherwise (e.g. introduce a tax credit). Whereas I think of philanthropy as being more of a kickstarter / seed round / injection of funding for ideas / something else I don’t really know how to articulate here</p>

<p>I’ve found thinking through these diff roles and their benefits/limitations helps clarify why grant funding is a tempting option, but often not that helpful long-term unless it’s done strategically (vs. “we have loads of $$ let’s just give it to ppl” - but then what?), as well as how each institutional actor is uniquely suited for diff types of contributions</p>

<p>Interesting to think about the “drudgerous”, middle-class kind of content creator. Like it’s both super-personalized and this intensely personal accomplishment to build a following around your work, yet at the same time there’s something incredibly interchangeable about the experience, which zoomed out is actually kinda banal. So like in some ways it’s not that different from any other paper-pushing job (and only more rarely do creators try to legacy-build beyond themselves), but it also does afford more day-to-day freedom that I think most ppl would find preferable to a true paper-pushing job. Not that different from startup founders either, I guess</p>

<h2 id="2020-08-25">2020-08-25</h2>
<p>There is something really charming about the cross-pollination effect that you see in highly verticalized / siloed creator communities (ex. streamers, YouTube creators, cam girls). Like you’d expect it to be hyper-competitive - your content is highly substitutable, the size/engagement of your audience directly feeds into your reputation and ability to make $$ - but it’s weirdly the opposite, people cross-promote all the time and it’s seen as a really good thing</p>

<p>I guess I just find it interesting bc ppl like to armchair-theorize in a Malthusian way about “what happens when ppl subscribe to too many things at once, there has to be an upper bound here,” yet creators’ behavior doesn’t bear that out at all. If they were worried about that, they’d be much more tight-fisted about their audience, but intuitively I think they get that their total supply is basically infinite, even if some ppl rotate through. The fact that creators themselves don’t seem to be concerned about it suggests it’s prob not really an issue</p>

<p>I think leaning into the idea that philanthropy is fundamentally not a democratic endeavor actually makes it <em>more</em> interesting, w/ potential for more impact. There’s a strange dance we do around the power dynamics, maybe bc it makes us uncomfortable, that IMO kind of muddles the point of it all. At its best, I think creativitiy and innovation, rather than wealth redistribution, should be the point of philanthropy. (I think!) More of an “empire building” than a socialist theory of change</p>

<p>It’s funny to consider why mainstream ppl feel comfortable talking about onlyfans vs other adult entertainment products in the past</p>

<p>One theory is that we’re all just more comfortable discussing this stuff in public now</p>

<p>Another might be that onlyfans is by definition more sanitized than, say, pornhub or myfreecams, bc everything hyperexplicit that would make ppl blush to share is hidden behind a paywall. Similarly to why suicidegirls became cool and talkworthy in its day. Was more like high-end pinup or whatever</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a similar learning for paywalled content more broadly? Like if the most polarizing and objectionable content is safely hiddden behind a paywall, within the confines of a higher-context community, then it’s easier for the general public to talk about / evangelize the concept of the thing itself (need for free discourse, etc)?</p>

<p>A world in which OnlyFans becomes a replacement for porn is actually pretty mindboggling to consider, the trajectory mirrors exactly what happened to all other forms of content. Ppl used to have to pay for explicit content when it was locked into physical form (books/videos/DVDs), then the internet made everything free and the price went to zero (display ads on adult sites that are free to access)</p>

<p>Now I bet some ppl are more than happy to pay for adult content every month, but as subscriptions. On the one end there’s like, PornHub’s premium subscription (much like paying for Netflix), but the more interesting transition is this idea of paying a handful of creators directly via OnlyFans. You can pay to follow the ppl you like and it’s more about having an intimate relationship with the person (in a parasocial way, of course, but like - seeing THIS particular girl over any other girl is more interesting to you and therefore worth paying for)</p>

<p>I just distinctly remember when nobody thought ppl were ever gonna pay for adult content again after the internet made it all free and easily accessible, and yet, here we are. Reputation-based economies introducing a natural scarcity which make subscriptions a viable thing again</p>

Which has this perverse effect of making it seem like we’re often falling short of our expectations as a country, but it’s actually that ability to voice discontent (with ourselves, and with others) that IS the American dream</p>

<p>Like the same way Discord is messaging reimagined as audio-first, this would be messaging that’s…tactile-first?</p>

<p>COVID is first major shared narrative we’ve had since the advent of social media, right? The last one being 9/11? (I guess you could also argue 2016 election? But somehow that feels different to me) I guess I’d assumed (as did a lot of other ppl) that we were trending away from shared -&gt; fragmented narratives, so it feels worth considering 1) why we thought that and 2) why a shared narrative did manage to “succeed” in a very fragmented world today</p>

<p>Obvious reason being its immediate impact on everyone’s daily lives which makes it hard to ignore - is there anything we can learn from the structure of the problem, re: “conditions that make a shared narrative possible today” that we could apply to future shared narratives?</p>

<p>(Also worth considering: <em>how</em> do we experience shared narratives today? If previously it was gathering around a TV or radio, how does the narrative get passed around now? It’s weird bc I feel like most of it has been “sensed” rather than told to me - like we’re intuitively going through these diff phases of development together. If anything, reading about others’ experiences on social media doesn’t “inform” but rather startles me, bc it makes me feel seen in a weird way that’s somewhat disconcerting)</p>

<p>“Our home isn’t a place to have people over anymore”, it’s where we spend all our time, so we need to reorganize the house accordingly. –&gt; Made me think again about considering the <em>interior</em> of buildings as mini-cities, and how we’re kinda doing that with our homes now. Instead of the city sprawling outside around us, we’ve turned the city inwards. Ex. Dining room is now the office, kitchen is the restaurant, downstairs is going to the gym, bedroom is “going home” to sleep</p>

Like essentially steelman why bad healthcare is quintessentially American, instead of framing it as a crisis. Is that weird? I don’t mean to minimize the issue, I just feel like if nothing has changed in 100 years, maybe it’s worth reexamining why bad healthcare makes the US what it is - not from a “good” perspective necessarily, but maybe from an optimistic or at least neutral one?</p>

<p>Male “guru” Twitter is just as competitive as female “e-girl” Twitter. In both cases they’re trying to grow an empire/cult that’s centered around them, and they are constantly fighting against the innate substitutability of what they have to offer (which breeds competition). On the other hand, the existence of other similar guru/e-girl accounts helps to validate their brand “market”</p>

<p>Thinking about how content platforms have this model that’s free for everybody, but they make money off a smaller subset of “winners” (i.e. top creators) – and how that could compare to e.g. monetizing communities with membership fees or big events like conferences</p>

<p>I think what I find interesting about it is the idea of monetizing a small portion of your membership instead of trying to make money off of everyone (that two-sided marketplace model we’ve seen with paid subscriptions, too), which shifts the focus from scale to quality</p>

<p>We’re all trying to figure out the world together, even if a lot of knowledge exists in blog posts and tweets and our collective conscious, we still need these checkpoints.

<p>There’s a class of things that’s like “streaming for X” or “open source/GitHub for Y”, where ppl assume it works in one industry so it’ll transfer to another, without taking into account the particular cultural context (gaming, developers, etc) that allows those things to be true. Some parts are transferable of course, but without understanding the underlying context it’s hard for outsiders to know which parts are/aren’t</p>

<p>Roam is to bloggers what superhuman is to VCs - cultish product, but also b/c it creates this sort of ingroup unifying effect / externalizable status symbol where none quite existed before (ok, not quite true for VCs re: Superhuman, but maybe for “generally busy ppl who live in their inbox all day”. “Bloggers” is likewise a somewhat imprecise term for what I mean as generally curious and creative writer/researcher types)</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use it, it serves as this symbol to outsiders that “we’re a thing bc we have special tools that you wouldn’t understand the value of.” In both instances, it’s not immediately obvious to an outsider that these groups might have specialized tooling/needs. (“Don’t you just write stuff?” “Don’t you just have meetings w people?”) Having something for that group to show off to others, and to be able to say “See? We’re a thing!” is what makes it so culturally memorable</p>

<p>It seems like many of these products rarely make it beyond cult stage, bc their brand is based on being something other ppl don’t get, and to expand beyond that they have to cannibalize their own brand. But maybe that’s okay, too (for me, anyway, a 3rd party observer) - it’s just fun to see these cults emerge regardless. They’re basically communities w/ a thin layer of company/product wrapped around them</p>

<p>I think I find information suicide (is there a better term for this that’s not so depressing? identity switching?) interesting for the same reasons that other people find longevity interesting. I’m not <em>that</em> viscerallly interested in the prospect of living forever, or even for a very long time, but I <em>am</em> fascinated by the idea of my physical body being a vessel, separate from my brain/consciousness, that I can choose to wipe clean. Why shouldn’t I be able to start a new game under the same body?</p>

<p>There’s some parallel to longevity here bc the answer to both q’s is “biology dictates our social norms”…and in both cases it’s about challenging whether that biologically-driven life trajectory is something we have to cater to after all</p>

<p>Like if longevity is pitched as a failure of the imagination to think beyond our physical bodies and beyond death, I feel like there is also a failure of imagination to think about how else our physical bodies can be creatively repurposed during our current 80-year time span or whatever. If we have alts in our online world, why can’t we have alts in the physical world? (Or maybe alts isn’t quite the right comparison, bc plenty of people do have real-life alts that exist alongside their main identities, whereas I’m thinking more like wiping your current game entirely). I’m just sort of more surprised that ppl don’t play with this more? Or maybe they do and I’m just not aware of them?</p>

<p>Dream topic spectrum has narrowed to just a few things bc I have no other stimulation going on I guess? Now when I go to bed it feels like that’s when the real adventure begins - going to sleep is like embarking upon an odyssey</p>

<p>Reminds me of music festivals, where daytime you’re basically just killing time, recovering from the night before, everything is very slow paced, some ppl pretty much sleep through the day. And then nighttime is where things gets crazy, lights and costumes come out. Similarly my dreams right now are the real adventure, daytime is just passing the time in a quiet beige state</p>

<p>I find it sort of bothersome that there’s no way to opt out of my email inbox. I have an email address, and I use it for lots of things, mostly as a form of verification/identity (signing up for services, etc). But I don’t really want people to use it to reach me anymore</p>

<p>And like, yes, I can adapt to the volume, and become more ok with not responding to things, we all do this, etc…but the fact that I can’t just blanket opt-out of this communication arrangement if I want to feels kinda crazy to me. There’s no way to just…not receive messages from people anymore, and yet it also feels sort of rude if I don’t reply to them. (Esp when they’re not cold emails, but from acquaintances or friends)</p>

<p>I want to be able to just “turn off” my email inbox and use it pretty much solely as a clearinghouse - for managing services that are tied to my email account, and for any other “read-only” email that I can enjoy but am not expected to respond to (like newsletters from friends). Ppl often talk about how great email is bc it’s a protocol you can build on top of, but this is the flipside of it that I really don’t like</p>

<p>Ok here is maybe a theory re: the q about Medium vs Twitter design thing. Twitter is like a public space, but Medium is like visiting someone’s home - a semi-private space you’re invited into</p>

<p>When you’re out and about and using the same platform with multiple ppl, collapsed into one feed, it’s ok if it all looks the same. But when it’s YOUR home, it needs to reflect your personality</p>

<p>(Okay, but then why is this still not necessarily true for Etsy and Ebay? Is there something about displaying physical wares that feels more personal, like it’s more about what you’re selling vs. the software it’s housed in, so it doesn’t really matter? Also maybe b/c all e-commerce software is fairly homogenized, vs. blogs and personal websites, where you have more options?)</p>

<p>Just realized what’s really cool about Stardew Valley is they manage to evoke a lot of emotion and attachment to the villagers despite the characters saying very little, but they do it by leaning into stereotypes. They let you fill in the blanks with stuff you already know about ppl and the world, and they do a lot of heavy lifting with symbols, hobbies, and mannerisms of speaking</p>

<p>Like it’s incredible how much you feel like you “know” these characters, but it’s actually bc you know people LIKE them in real life, and then project that experience onto the characters. I guess I find it surprising or clever b/c the naive take on “how to create a super immersive world” would be filling it in with lots of details, like Skyrim or RDR2, to achieve that level of emotion, but you don’t actually have to. In this case, fewer but really on-the-mark details are better bc it lets the player’s brain endlessly fill in the rest</p>

<p>Fun to see new “SKUs”/vehicles for interesting ppl to collaborate together…you could even think of them like stages of economic development, Rostow-style, but for tech industry</p>

<p>(from a friend) “Tech only recently discovered culture” &lt;- this isn’t meant as a dig on tech, maybe just imprecise vocabulary (what the heck even is “culture” in this context), but I keep thinking about it. Like of course tech has always had its own “culture”, but there is something different about the past few years where it feels like tech is taking interest in “liberal arts” or whatever you want to call it, and slowly figuring out its identity there. And with that comes a widenening of SKUs for collaboration</p>

<p>Originally the only SKU in recent tech history was startups (maybe prior to that: gov’t-funded research labs? writing software together?). Like if you have a great idea, start a company. That was it. Then it was starting a VC fund and/or angel investing together. Next vehicles I’m looking forward to: starting a think tank / research firm together, starting a media publication / some sort of loudspeaker together</p>

<p>Anyways, regardless of the exact specifics, I like thinking about all these different vehicles that will fall in and out of fashion over time. Sometimes you come across a group of interesting ppl that would clearly form a dream team for something, but it’s like…what’s the right vehicle for their output? So much potential energy that doesn’t always have the right outlet</p>

<p>Ex. there are v diff types of ppl who say rekt, roasted, and shook, or SMH vs “you hate to see it”. It’s not generational or geography-based, I think it’s just tribal?</p>

<p>Has that existed <em>online</em> before? There was definitely nerd-only slang like l33t or pwned, and then there’s general early internet slang like rofl and afk, and then I felt like there was like briefly early gen Z vs millennial slang, but now it feels like there are lots of diff “languages” coexisting online across generations and geographies</p>

<p>(theory from a friend) People vote in national but not local politics bc they know they have more agency over local stuff, whereas national stuff they feel more powerless about, so this is the only thing they can do to affect it</p>

<p>There’s some parallel here to me between how people undervalue local politics, and the idea that “we treat the people closest to us worse than anyone else”. Like somehow having this greater level of intimacy actually makes people take it more for granted</p>

<p>Thinking about my email inbox like an airport or some sort of transit hub for all my other communications</p>

<p>Nothing wants to stay in there for long, the content is sort of nervously transient. it’s a place for ppl to get “processed” in transit to/from something else. There’s bureaucratic stuff in there (credit card notifications, insurance, etc). There are email notifications from other apps you use, which nudge you to get a move on and go back to those apps. Actual letters from friends feel like these sort of beautiful paper missives swirling in a dust cloud of desolation. You’re standing in the middle of a desert, but occasionally you reach your hand up and grab this letter and open it, and in it is some nice thoughtful longform note from someone you like and care about. You fold it back up and release it back into the wind. (Of course you don’t respond, even though you wish you had, and feel vaguely guilty that you didn’t, because you’re trapped out here in the desert wasteland of email. Their letter stays fondly on your mind for the next few weeks, before fading into the dust like everything else)</p>

<h2 id="2020-02-19">2020-02-19</h2>
<p>One possible answer to the eternal q of “Why does media attract such left-leaning ppl?” is that for most ppl, there’s no money in media (as an individual journalist, writer etc - not the industry overall). Right-leaning ppl go off and get high-paying jobs doing other stuff bc of their values, whereas left-leaning people are less likely to do so bc it conflicts with their values. So, crazy posit is that “liberal media bias” is bc working in media (and academia, while we’re at it) isn’t a sufficiently lucrative job, so it only attracts a certain type of person who’s willing to work in those conditions. But making media a financially attractive prospect would balance out POVs represented</p>

<h2 id="2020-02-18">2020-02-18</h2>
<p>Trying out this thought for size…if you’re providing a service for people to start their own businesses, then they need customization options. Medium pages can all look the same bc they’re (mostly) free, or GitHub repos or whatever, vs. Shopify or WordPress which let you customize everything. (Counterpoints: Etsy, Ebay, others? Ok so maybe the difference isn’t about charging money vs. not…)</p>

<p>Why does it feel like big-name blogs are always built on custom websites, but then everyone is fine building their own personal brands on Twitter/Instagram/etc?</p>

<p>In other words: why does building a personal brand on Medium feel icky, but building a personal brand on Twitter does not, even though both are equally homogenizing? Where’s the dividing line between customization vs. platform brand? It feels like there is actually a right answer to this but I’m not quite sure how to think about it yet</p>

<p>What’s the half life of non-monarchic dynasties? (i.e. does all multigenerational wealth eventually dwindle down due to successors cannibalizing themselves?) And if they do have a half-life, why do people care so much about redistribution of wealth? If eventually their potential energy gets consumed by the ecosystem and makes room for someone new</p>

<p>I mean it’s also possible we haven’t even had enough generations of self-made wealth to understand how this works. We’re just seeing the tail end of Rockefeller Carnegie etc era now. To me it seems likely that all impossibly wealthy dynasties will die out over time, so it makes me feel less angsty about the ones that are being built today. And even, I think, makes the case for why they’re especially interesting / good for the general public, when I look at it from a lifecycle perspective (their job IS to be big and impactful for the relatively short duration that they’ll exist)</p>

<p>Something I don’t really get: with some hedonistic experiences, eventually after doing them repeatedly for awhile, they start to lose their novelty/appeal. But other hedonistic inputs don’t have that quality. Why not?</p>

<p>Ex. college-style partying eventually starts to lose its appeal for most people, but eating sugar is still just as enjoyable, on a visceral level, as when you’re 6 years old. (Specific examples might vary between people, but you get what I mean)</p>

<p>Is e.g. eating sugar just a purer form of wireheading? Like the stuff that eventually gets old is bc the novelty of it actually derives from its <em>narrative</em>, which starts to feel familiar and therefore less interesting (new relationship energy, college partying, etc), whereas other experiences are pure clean hedonistic input</p>

<p>Like for me it feels like eating bone marrow, oysters, sashimi, beef tartare, caviar, etc never gets old, bc the thing that gives me joy about it is directly inputted into my brain, with nothing else interfering w/ it</p>

<p>Starting to feel like ppl need personal SLAs that detail the messaging apps they do/don’t “support” (iMessage, email, whatsapp, etc). Ex. I might have a Telegram or LinkedIn account but I won’t respond to your messages on there, too much inbound to support every channel</p>

<p>Part of what is/isn’t supported also depends on who’s messaging, what they message about, and overall volume to that channel. Ex. I support Signal only bc hardly anyone messages me there (and the few who do are close friends), but I’d be less responsive to ppl I don’t know on there, vs. it’s more acceptable to cold email or cold DM on Twitter. And I support iMessage only bc I only use it with friends, don’t use it for work etc, but I wouldn’t respond to a random person on iMessage</p>

<p>I’ve gotten significantly worse at supporting Twitter DM since I tried funneling more ppl over there vs. email. It’s still better than email I think, bc the messages are shorter, but the tradeoff is higher volume which makes it harder to respond quickly vs. before</p>

<p>Whereas my disinclination to use e.g. WhatsApp is mostly product-related (no reactions, and the notification badge disappears when you open it, so I forget to go back and check it). But enough ppl that I know use it that I feel like I can’t fully “deprecate” it</p>

<p>Reading chronic city and thinking about degenerate lifestyles.

<p>In that sense, classical degens have more in common with monks, although monks took an ascetic interpretation. Monks are about restriction as a means of reducing distractions (neo-monks are, of course, the IFers and soylenters and dopamine fasters), degen approach is about living a purposely unfiltered life so as not to miss any truthiness that might come your way. Classical degens avoid discarding any important clues that might aid in the pursuit of truth, which manifests as excessiveness. (Degens as the maximalist counterpart to monks?)</p>

<p>I don’t even really know if I’d classify neo-degens as truth-seeking (ditto neo-monks - they’re both commodified versions of the original) but in both cases it seems like there’s this extreme allergic response to default status games, which manifests in either ascetic or maximalist behavior</p>

<p>Anti-pattern recognition</p>

<p>“the true essence of madness is seeing everything around you as a meaningful symbol” - toby</p>

<p>Chronic city, pattern recognition are both (in diff ways) about learning to avoid the tendency to find symbols where there are none</p>

<p>“Being basic as a virtue” is sort of a stop-gap prevention mechanism from inadvertently descending into madness. Forces you to resist temptation to pattern match. And more broadly: if you’re truly dedicated to truth-seeking, switching up your identity and blowing up your life every so often keeps you on the run from the eye of sauron. Fool the pattern-matchers, render yourself unrecognizable from dark forces</p>

<p>Another version of this is the Trouble Coffee founder who got tattoos and wore the same clothes everywhere because she was afraid of forgetting herself. “The more people who recognized her, the more she stood a chance of being able to recognize herself.” (Cayce being afraid of logos and branded clothing in Pattern Recognition is relevant here too)</p>

<p>There’s some common theme here that I like…something about how you can create these external markers to do something that you don’t fully trust yourself to do. And also, how external markers can form a protective shell to mask our true identities, allow us to safely disappear</p>
